 ## Title of the Project
LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
As the data are increasing daily due to digitization in the banking sector, people want to apply for loans through the internet. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a typical method for information investigation, has gotten more consideration increasingly. Individuals of various businesses are utilizing AI calculations to take care of the issues dependent on their industry information. Banks are facing a significant problem in the approval of the loan. Daily there are so many applications that are challenging to manage by the bank employees, and also the chances of some mistakes are high. Most banks earn profit from the loan, but it is risky to choose deserving customers from the number of applications. One mistake can make a massive loss to a bank. Loan distribution is the primary business of almost every bank. This project aims to provide a loan [1, 8] to a deserving applicant out of all applicants. An efficient and non-biased system that reduces the bank’s time employs checking every applicant on a priority basis. The bank authorities complete all other customer’s other formalities on time, which positively impacts the customers. The best part is that it is efficient for both banks and applicants. This system allows jumping on particular applications that deserve to be approved on a priority basis.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
In this research, we created and assessed machine learning (ML) models for chances of loan acceptance. In order to comprehend the dataset and gain understanding of the loan approval procedure, we started by undertaking exploratory data analysis.Then, we trained and assessed several classification models, including the Logistic Regression, the Linear Discriminant Analysis and the Random Forest Classifier. We used accuracy as  evaluation criteria to assess these models performance.Using these accuracy results further we can able get a result that will be useful for the banking sectors to decide whether they can able to approve loan for a customer according to his provided data.
